Using a Neural Network to Predict Loan Approval

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to predict if applicants will be successful with funding by analyzing the provided data using neural network and machine learning applications.

Results

Data Preprocessing

The targets for our model is the ask amount versus the income amount. Other considerations, such as type of company and if they have backers already or not, should be considered features to the data. Identifiers such as ID number and company name are extraneous to our data.

Compilation, Training and Evaluation

For this case study we initially selected 15 nuerons over two layers with 2 activation functions, to create a baseline from a basic network. Based on results, we feel this is not target model performance and more layers and nuerons would need to be added. We tried to increase efficiency by adding layers, neurons, and epochs, but overall accuracy did not imporve in a statistically significant way.

Summary

Overall, the model used for this was somewhat dissapointing. Its accuracy was barely better than a coin flip and the ways we attempted to improve it bore little fruit. A complete re-examining of our model may be in order.
